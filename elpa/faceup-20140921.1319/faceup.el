;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs is capable of highlighting buffers based on language-specific
;; `font-lock' rules. This package, `faceup', makes it possible to
;; perform regression test for packages that provide font-lock rules.
;;
;; The underlying idea is to convert text with highlights ("faces")
;; into a plain text representation using the Faceup markup language.
;; By comparing the current highlight with a highlight performed with
;; earlier versions of a package, it's possible to find problems that
;; otherwise would have been hard to spot.
;;
;; The `faceup' package is designed to be used in conjunction with
;; Ert, the standard Emacs regression test system.
;;
;; The Faceup markup language is a generic markup language, regression
;; testing is merely one way to use it.

;; Installation:
;;
;; This package is designed to be installed with the Emacs built-in
;; package manager.

;; Regression test examples:
;;
;; This section describes the two typical ways regression testing with
;; this package is performed.
;;
;;
;; Full source file highlighting:
;;
;; The most straight-forward way to perform regression testing is to
;; collect a number of representative source files. From each source
;; file, say `alpha.mylang', you can use `M-x faceup-write-file RET'
;; to generate a Faceup file named `alpha.mylang.faceup', this file
;; use the Faceup markup language to represent the text with
;; highlights and is used as a reference in future tests.
;;
;; An Ert test case can be defined as follows:
;;
;;    (require 'faceup)
;;
;;    (defvar mylang-font-lock-test-dir (faceup-this-file-directory))
;;
;;    (defun mylang-font-lock-test-apps (file)
;;      "Test that the mylang FILE is fontifies as the .faceup file describes."
;;      (faceup-test-font-lock-file 'mylang-mode
;;                                  (concat mylang-font-lock-test-dir file)))
;;    (faceup-defexplainer mylang-font-lock-test-apps)
;;
;;    (ert-deftest mylang-font-lock-file-test ()
;;      (should (mylang-font-lock-test-apps "apps/FirstApp/alpha.mylang"))
;;      ;; ... Add more test files here ...
;;      )
;;
;; To execute the tests simply run something like `M-x ert RET t RET'.
;;
;;
;; Source snippets:
;;
;; To test smaller snippets of code, you can use the
;; `faceup-test-font-lock-string'. It takes a major mode and a string
;; written using the Faceup markup language. The functions strips away
;; the Faceup markup, inserts the plain text into a temporary buffer,
;; highlights it, converts the result back into the Faceup markup
;; language, and finally compares the result with the original Faceup
;; string.
;;
;; For example:
;;
;;    (defun mylang-font-lock-test (faceup)
;;      (faceup-test-font-lock-string 'mylang-mode faceup))
;;    (faceup-defexplainer mylang-font-lock-test)
;;
;;    (ert-deftest mylang-font-lock-test-simple ()
;;      "Simple MyLang font-lock tests."
;;      (should (mylang-font-lock-test "«k:this» is a keyword"))
;;      (should (mylang-font-lock-test "«k:function» «f:myfunc» («v:var»)")))
;;

;; Executing the tests:
;;
;; Once the tests have been defined, you can use `M-x ert RET t RET'
;; to execute them. Hopefully, you will be given the "all clear".
;; However, if there is a problem, you will be presented with
;; something like:
;;
;;     F mylang-font-lock-file-test
;;         (ert-test-failed
;;          ((should
;;            (mylang-font-lock-test-apps "apps/FirstApp/alpha.mylang"))
;;           :form
;;           (mylang-font-lock-test-apps "apps/FirstApp/alpha.mylang")
;;           :value nil :explanation
;;           ((on-line 2
;;     		("but_«k:this»_is_not_a_keyword")
;;     		("but_this_is_not_a_keyword")))))
;;
;; You should read this that on line 2, the old font-lock rules
;; highlighted `this' inside `but_this_is_not_a_keyword' (which is
;; clearly wrong), whereas the new doesn't. Of course, if this is the
;; desired result (for example, the result of a recent change) you can
;; simply regenerate the .faceup file and store it as the reference
;; file for the future.

;; The Faceup markup language:
;;
;; The Faceup markup language is designed to be human-readable and
;; minimalistic.
;;
;; The two special characters `«' and `»' are used to indicate the
;; start and end of a section containing a specific face. The start
;; marker contains information about the face. A number of faces have
;; a shorthand notation, e.g. `«U:abc»' means that the text "abc" is
;; underlined. Other faces are expressed with their full name, e.g.
;; `«:my-face:abc»'.
;;
;; If more than one face is present at the same location, faceup
;; represents this as nested marks, where the foremost face is the
;; inner one, in the faceup representation.
;;
;; For example, if the text `abcDEFghi' is in *warning* face and the
;; `DEF' substring is *underlined*, this is represented as
;; `«W:abc«U:DEF»ghi»'.
;;
;; In case the use of faces do not nest, the ranges will be split when
;; represented in Faceup. Concretely, consider the string `abcdefghi'
;; where `abcdef' are bold and `defghi' underlined. In case it will be
;; represented in Faceup as `«B:abc«U:def»»«U:ghi»'
;;
;; Any occurrence of the start or end markers in the original text will
;; be "escaped" using the start marker in the `faceup' representation.
;; In other words, the sequences `««' and `«»' represent a start and
;; end marker, respectively.
;;
;; Limitations:
;;
;; Faceup only supports the `face' attribute. (Some font-lock packages
;; set other attributes like `help-echo'.)
;;
;; Faceup supports only named faces. It does not support face
;; properties where colors or attributes are used directly.

;; Reference section:
;;
;; Faceup commands and functions:
;;
;; `M-x faceup-write-file RET' - generate a Faceup file based on the
;; current buffer.
;;
;; `M-x faceup-view-file RET' - view the current buffer converted to
;; Faceup.
;;
;; `faceup-markup-{string,buffer}' - convert text with face properties
;; to the Faceup markup language.
;;
;; `faceup-render-{string,buffer,buffer-to-string}' - convert a text
;; with Faceup markup to a text with face properties.
;;
;; `faceup-clean-{buffer,string}' - remove Faceup markup.
;;
;; 
;; Regression test support:
;;
;; The following functions can be used as Ert test functions, or can
;; be used to implement new Ert test functions.
;;
;; `faceup-test-equal' - Test function, work like Ert:s `equal', but
;; more ergonomically when reporting multi-line string errors.
;; Concretely, it breaks down multi-line strings into lines and
;; reports which line number the error occurred on and the content of
;; that line.
;;
;; `faceup-test-font-lock-buffer' - Test that a buffer is highlighted
;; according to a reference Faceup text, for a specific major mode.
;;
;; `faceup-test-font-lock-string' - Test that a text with Faceup
;; markup is refontified to match the original Faceup markup.
;;
;; `faceup-test-font-lock-file' - Test that a file is highlighted
;; according to a reference .faceup file.
;;
;; `faceup-defexplainer' - Macro, define an explainer function and set
;; the `ert-explainer' property on the original function, for
;; functions based on the above test functions.
;;
;; `faceup-this-file-directory' - Macro, the directory of the current
;; file.

;; Real-world examples:
;;
;; The following are examples of real-world package that use faceup to
;; test their font-lock keywords.
;;
;; * [cmake-font-lock](https://github.com/Lindydancer/cmake-font-lock)
;;   an advanced set of font-lock keywords for the CMake language
;;
;; * [objc-font-lock](https://github.com/Lindydancer/objc-font-lock)
;;   highlight Objective-C function calls.

Of course, this only work for test functions aware of this

This is intended to be used to simplify `ert' explain functions,
which could be defined as:

Alternative, you can use the macro `faceup-defexplainer' as follows:

    (faceup-defexplainer my-test)

Test functions, like `faceup-test-font-lock-buffer', built on top
of `faceup-test-equal', and other functions that adhere to this

  "Compares two (multi-line) strings, LHS and RHS, for equality.

This is intended to be used in Ert regression test rules.

When `faceup-test-explain' is non-nil, instead of returning nil
on inequality, a list is returned with a explanation what
differs. Currently, this function reports 1) if the number of
lines in the strings differ. 2) the lines and the line numbers on
which the string differed.

For example:
    (let ((a \"ABC\\nDEF\\nGHI\")

When used in an `ert' rule, the output is as below:
